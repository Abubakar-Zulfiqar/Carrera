      "To get professional styling and drying results at home, you need the right tool: a Carrera hairdryer with a powerful AC motor. That’s what’s at the heart of every professional salon tool. With 2,400 watts, the Carrera AC Hairdryer can accelerate the controlled airstream to speeds faster than a hurricane! Plus it has all the features you'd expect from a salon quality styling tool.",

And this power to weight ratio is exactly what a professional stylist is looking for in a quality styling tool. That comes in at 2,400 watts for those who are counting. And with a perfectly balanced weight of only 984g the ergonomic rubber accented handle makes it easy to keep a firm and controlled grip on all that power.",

    section3Details2:
      "It's easier to style precisely and creatively when you use a narrower nozzle, particularly when using a round brush. And the narrower the nozzle the more powerful the air flow. It's these sort of differences that make the Carrera hairdryer the choice of professionals.",

The ions mix into the airstream as they flow from the ion generator, wrapping themselves around your hair follicles creating a smooth, fizz-free, lustrous result. Also your hair dries much quicker, which is a welcome bonus. The ioniser can be switched on and off to suit your styling requirements.",

Argan oil is one of the most valued plant-based hair treatment oils and provides essential moisture while strengthening roots and helping prevent split ends.
